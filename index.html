        <h2 class="center">Event Details</h2>
        <h3 class="green">HarvestFest: October 6th - 9th 2023</h3>
<b>No one is permitted on the grounds before 3:00 pm on the first day.</b> <br>
The site is hosting another event before ours begins. So, please make travel arrangements accordingly, or take advantage of the local restaurants and shops until then. <br><br>
<b>EVERYONE attending the festival is expected to take ALL garbage and recyclables home with them.</b> <br>
The Earth is our mother. Do not litter anywhere. If you see litter, pick it up. Leave your site as if you never were. Thank you! 
        <h3 class="center green">Programming</h3> 
        <p>Programming Details will be available closer to the festival date. If you are interested in leading a workshop please contact us at board.wiccanfest@gmail.com</p>
        <h3 class="center green">Vendors</h3>
        <p>As a vendor, you must register and pay the same fees as all other participants. You can vend as much or as little as you like and are welcome to attend any programmed events at your discretion. To keep folks from wandering through people's private campsites, there is a designated vending area called the Marketplace. All vending takes place outside. You are responsible for your own setup and, according to our insurance, must have your own commercial liability insurance. If you are interested in advertising in the program booklet, the rate is $100 per half page, payable 3 weeks before the festival, with artwork sent in. We have no particular rules about signage or POS materials on site as long as they do not create a safety hazard or impede movement through the camp. The sale of any alcohol is prohibited.</p>
        <h3 class="center green">Festival Rules</h3>
        <p>The staff of Wic-Can Fest does not wish to curtail your enjoyment.

<h3 class="center green">Site Information</h3> 
<p class="center">"We believe that above all else, we are called to love one another - without caveats.  As simple as it is to say, loving others just as we wish to be loved ourselves is not simple for anyone. Loving others doesn’t just mean caring for them, it means that we have to acknowledge their humanity, and their perspective. It means accepting people as they are, right here and now. To open the door to the stranger, and provide a safe space for everyone."<br> - <i>Sparrow Lake Camp on Faith.</i>

        <h2 class="center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>Please reach us at board.wiccanfest@gmail.com if you cannot find an answer to your question.</p>
        <h3 class="green">Do I have to be Wiccan to attend Wic-Can Fest?</h3>
        <p>Of course not. Wic-Can Fest is open to everyone from all different communities worldwide and their friends.</p>
        <h3 class="green">Do I have to make a reservation to attend Wic-Can Fest?</h3>
        <p>No, you don’t have to make a reservation, but pre-registering is highly recommended. We have limited indoor cabin space and work on a first-come-first-served basis. Once the cabins are full, the remaining spaces left are for camping.</p>
        <h3 class="green">How early can I arrive on the first day?</h3>
        <p>You can not arrive prior to 3:00 pm. If you do, you will be responsible for paying the day fee as charged by the Outdoor Center (the owners of the site) in addition to the full cost of attending Wic-Can Fest.</p>
        <h3 class="green">Can I drink the water at the Festival?</h3>
        <p>Drinking water will be available in the kitchen. Feel free to fill up your drinking receptacles at the sink if no one is there. Please do not drink the water from the washroom faucets.</p>
        <h3 class="green">I plan to camp outdoors. Can I create a fire pit at my campsite if one doesn’t already exist?</h3>
        <p>No! It is absolutely forbidden to create any new fire pits. You must use the pre-existing ones or bring an above-ground metal basin, including its screen.</p>
        <h3 class="green">Is Wic-Can Fest child friendly?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Wic-Can Fest is a family-oriented festival. The festival site affords children a unique setting to explore their pagan heritage in a safe and constructive environment. Children under 12 MUST be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or sitter. Children are not permitted to run wild on the site.</p>
        <h3 class="green">What is the weather like?</h3>
<p>Weather varies from year to year. However, we typically experience daytime temperatures between 17-28 degrees Celsius, with overnight temperatures dropping to 10-19 degrees Celsius. We recommend checking the weather ahead of time and preparing for both rain and shine.</p>
<h3 class="green">Are there shower facilities at Wic-Can Fest?</h3>
<p>Full, hot showers and public bathrooms are available onsite, with outhouses in the camping areas.</p>
<h3 class="green">Can I bring musical instruments to the festival?</h3>
<p>Yes. Music is a big part of all of the pagan traditions. However, we ask that you do not bring any instruments that require electric amplification without asking us first. </p>
<h3 class="green">Are pets allowed at Wic-Can Fest?</h3>
<p>We are unable to accommodate pets at the site. Service animals are always welcome!</p>
<h3 class="green">Can I bring a trailer?</h3>
<p>Trailer spots are VERY limited. The site is not designed for trailer accommodations, so no water or hydro connections exist. If you want to bring a trailer, please email us at board.wiccanfest@gmail.com to ensure we have space for you! Depending on the size of the trailers, we can only accommodate 5-7 at a time.</p>
